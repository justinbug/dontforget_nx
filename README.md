# Sonic Triple Trouble 16-Bit — Nintendo Switch port

This is a wrapper/port of the Android version of *Sonic Triple Trouble 16-Bit* (`com.noahncopeland.game`, v1.2.8). It loads the original game binaries and runs them: we natively run the original Android ARM64 `.so` file inside a minimal emulated Android environment on the Nintendo Switch.

### How to Install

To play this game, you will need the **`.apk`** file for **version 1.2.8** (Android arm64-v8a build). You can get it for free from the official page:

👉 **[https://gamejolt.com/games/sonictripletrouble16bit/322794](https://gamejolt.com/games/sonictripletrouble16bit/322794)**

> Download → select the **Android (arm64-v8a)** build.

From it, you need:
* **`lib/arm64-v8a/libyoyo.so`** — the GameMaker Studio 2 game engine.
* **`lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so`** — the C++ runtime.
* The **entire `assets/` folder** from your `.apk` (containing `game.win`, `audiogroup*.dat`, and all other game data).
* The **`.apk` file itself**, renamed to **`game.apk`**.

#### Setup Instructions:

1. Create a folder called `stt16bit_nx` inside the `switch` folder on your SD card (i.e. `sdmc:/switch/stt16bit_nx/`).
2. Extract **`lib/arm64-v8a/libyoyo.so`** from your `.apk` and copy it to `sdmc:/switch/stt16bit_nx/libyoyo.so`.
3. Extract **`lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so`** from your `.apk` and copy it to `sdmc:/switch/stt16bit_nx/libc++_shared.so`.
4. Copy the **entire `assets/` folder** from your `.apk` into `sdmc:/switch/stt16bit_nx/assets/`.
5. Copy the **`.apk` file itself** to `sdmc:/switch/stt16bit_nx/` and rename it to **`game.apk`** (so its path is `sdmc:/switch/stt16bit_nx/game.apk`).
6. Copy **`stt16bit_nx.nro`** into `sdmc:/switch/stt16bit_nx/`.

Your final layout should look like this:

```
sdmc:/switch/stt16bit_nx/
├── stt16bit_nx.nro
├── libyoyo.so
├── libc++_shared.so
├── game.apk
└── assets/
    ├── game.win
    ├── audiogroup0.dat
    ├── audiogroup1.dat
    └── ... (all other asset files)
```

### Notes

* This port **will not work** in applet mode (Album). Please launch the Homebrew Menu using a game override (hold the **R** button while launching any installed game) to give it full memory access and the required syscalls.
* Save data (`YoYoPrefsFile.txt`) and `config.txt` are kept in `sdmc:/switch/stt16bit_nx/`.

### Configuration

`config.txt` is created on first run and supports the following options:
* `screen_width` / `screen_height` — render resolution; invalid values automatically pick 1280×720 in handheld mode and 1920×1080 in docked mode.
* `language` — game language code (e.g. `en`, `de`, `fr`, `es`, `it`, `pt`, `ru`, `ja`).

### How to Build

You will need the `devkitA64` toolchain and the following `devkitPro` packages:
* `switch-dev`
* `switch-sdl2`
* `switch-mesa`
* `switch-libdrm_nouveau`
* `switch-freetype`
* `switch-libpng`
* `switch-ffmpeg`

Run `make` to compile.
